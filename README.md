## Text To Handwritten Font
In this project, we are converting text to a handwritten font.

The source code for the project is in "text_to_handwritten_font.py" file, what each line does is explained using comments in the .py file.

When we run the code, the welcome message gets displayed initially and once the image is loaded, the print message after successfull execution is displayed, this can be seen in the "console.png" file.

The output in the form of image is in "output_tth.png".
